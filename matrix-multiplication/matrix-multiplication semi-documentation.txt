*all programs are full prove (with non-trevial lemmas and calcs) and create an execute file

matrix-multiplication

it's the longest prove with a lot of non-trevial lemma and calc 

we had three loop at each one we ensures the invariant the gaurd the decreases (following assighment).

the first loop we ensures that the row i in m3 had the right value
the second loop ensures that for every colmun m3 and a row it had the right value
the third loop ensures that the calc of m3[i,j] it will have the right value.

for each loop we had to prove lemma's and calc
we sperated the loops and the assighment to find all violations somehow dafny will convence without any needed non-trevial lemmas.

the program just had loop work (we done it all semester) and all the work was to choose the right predicates.

-in this program there are non-trevial calcs.
-the program compile and create binary file to execute.
*in frontier there is non-trevial lemma and in quickSort there is no need for it as show in the semi-documnation.
